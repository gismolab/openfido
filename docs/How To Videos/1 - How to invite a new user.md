If you are an organization admin, you can invite a new user to your organization.

Go to the "Users" tab.

Click on + Invite User.

Enter their email address into the input and click "Invite".

If the user already has an account, they will be added to the organization when they accept the invitation.

If they do not already have an account, they will be prompted to create a new user account.
