# Openfido-utils

Summary: Common [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) blueprints and database structers shared between openfido-workflow-service and openfido-app-service.

## Vocabulary

 * Application = an HTTP client that is authorized to access a REST endpoint.
 * Application System Permission = an assignment of an Application to a specific System Permission.
 * System Permission = a specific operation that an application is allowed to perform.

## Architectural Decision Records

* [1. Record architecture decisions](docs/adr/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md)
* [2. Migrate from openfido-workflow-service](docs/adr/0002-migrate-from-openfido-workflow-service.md)

## Development

To test this system:

    pipenv shell
    pipenv install --dev

    # run all tests and styling (as CircleCI)
    pipenv precommit

## Deploying

To build this project, and deploy it:

    python setup.py install

## Openfido command

This project also includes a command called 'openfido'. (Use the installation
instructions above to install it.)

Here is a sample of its existing commands (to aid working with workflows):

    openfido --email ... --password ... --app-key ... --help

    usage: openfido [-h] [--log LOG] [--app-service APP_SERVICE] [--auth-service AUTH_SERVICE] --email EMAIL --password PASSWORD --app-key APP_KEY {workflow} ...

    Interract with openFIDO services

    positional arguments:
      {workflow}            sub-command help
        workflow            Manage Workflows

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --log LOG, -l LOG     Log level (default: WARN)
      --app-service APP_SERVICE, -ss APP_SERVICE
                            App API URL
      --auth-service AUTH_SERVICE, -as AUTH_SERVICE
                            Auth API URL
      --email EMAIL, -e EMAIL
                            OpenFIDO email
      --password PASSWORD, -p PASSWORD
                            OpenFIDO password
      --app-key APP_KEY, -ak APP_KEY
                            OpenFIDO App API application token


    openfido --email ... --password ... --app-key ... workflow --help

    Create and monitory workflows.

    positional arguments:
      {view,list,dot,create,update}
                            workflow commands
        view                View a Workflow
        list                List Workflows
        dot                 Graphviz dot file of a Workflow
        create              Create a Workflow
        update              Update a Workflow

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit

The format required by this command line tool [documented here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13gsyF0nshtw6b8iiW70NqQQNW4RyysqnjEOyykm7MS4/edit). In summary:

    {
      “name”: “My Workflow”,
      “description”: “A workflow that does cool things”,
      “pipelines”: [
        { 
    “id”: “abc1234”,
    },
    { 
    “id”: “abc1235”,
    “dependencies”: [“abc1234”]
    },
      ]
    }

## Flask Usage

This package includes a subset of libraries for role-based application
authentication. To use it, simply include this library in your project's
dependencies:

Configure your application to use your application's specific application roles:

    from enum import IntEnum, unique

    @unique
    class ExamplePermissions(IntEnum):
        """ Permissions used for Flask endpoints """

        ROLE_1 = 1
        ROLE_2 = 2

Make sure that your application's [Flask Migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) configuration includes the tables used to manage these roles.

    # file that sets up 'db':
    from application_roles.models import db as roles_db

    # import your own models
    from .models import db

Finally, make a decorator to enforce these permissions in your views:

    from application_roles.decorators import make_permission_decorator

    permissions_required = make_permission_decorator(ExamplePermissions)

    @permissions_required([ExamplePermissions.ROLE_1])
    @route("/protected_route")
    def protected_route():
        return 'private info'


HTTP clients must then pass a `Workflow-API-Key` header with their api_key. Keys can
be created using the sample code in tasks.py:

    # Create a new Application database record with PIPELINES_CLIENT role.
    invoke create-application-key -n "new app" -p PIPELINES_CLIENT
